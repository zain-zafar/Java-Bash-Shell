//Sprint 1 Backlog.  
June 15 to June 21


Assuming JShell is running and we are able to take user input, then the User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user, I must be able to gather a history of my commands from the oldest command to the most recent command. I must also be able to specify the number
of the most recent commands I would like to see.
b) As a user, I must be able to make a directory relative to the current directory or by a full path.
c) As a user, I must be able to change the current directory to another by a location relative to the current directory or by a full path.
d) As a user, I must be able to print out the current working directory.	


Specific tasks to be accomplished:
a-1. (JShell) Begin coding the structure of the command line interpreter
a-2. (JShell) Have the shell continually prompt the user for input
