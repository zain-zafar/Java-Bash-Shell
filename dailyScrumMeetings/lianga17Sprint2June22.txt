What did I do last time?
	- We switched up the tasks and I completed the Log class and the History class such that commands will be stored and accessed at ease.
	- As a team, we got together and updated the product backlog and the CRC Cards to account for the new requirements

What do I plan to do now?
	- I will first implement the echo overwrite command.
	- Next, I will work on the ls command where it will access the ArrayList and output the correct files.
	- As part of the group, I will contribute to the Find command.
	- The Commands class will continuously be updated as new commands are being made.
	- I will also add and update the Javadocs for previously made classes.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- The TrackDirectories class must be implemented and running before I can work on the ls command and the find command.
