What did I do last time?
    - I reviewed the feedback given and started investigating areas of improvement for this session
    - I worked on the Driver class such that Echo and File will now work together properly

What do I plan to do now?
    - I plan to figure out the best way to implement the Cat class
    - I plan to discuss with team mates to better approach the design aspect and coding style of the project
    - I plan to finish my tasks and unit tests by the next sprint

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Currently blocked on figuring out the best approach for my design implementation
    - Using HashMap as it's a convenient resource, but first time trying it
