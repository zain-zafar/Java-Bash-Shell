What did I do last time?
    - I completed the File, Cat and Man classes from last time
    - I reviewed the JShell code and implemented my classes into the JShell

What do I plan to do now?
    - I plan to work together with teammates to complete the find class
    - I plan to attempt changing the design of some classes such that full requirements are met
    - I plan to test all classes to ensure they function properly

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Currently blocked on figuring out a design and implementation for the find class as it's a tough function
    - Unit testing and how it works
