What did I do last time?
    - I added honor code to every class.
    - Previously implemented MakeDirectory, ListFiles, ChangeDirectory, Tree, TrackDirectoriesMade, ValidateDirectory classes and helped to implement Commands class   

What do I plan to do now?
    - Starting from July 14th, I will implement the optional recursion argument for the ListFiles command
    - I will help my groupmates finish the implementation of File and Cat command. 

Am I blocked on anything?
    - No.
