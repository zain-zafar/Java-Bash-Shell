What did I do last time? 
	- I reviewed and implemented the CRC Cards.
	- Had the demo with a TA and went over design and implementation ideas.

What do I plan to do now?
	- Rethink a few design aspects to match the marking scheme.
	- Implement the EchoAppend class.
	- Work on the Find class with Kia and Ryan.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Nothing much, but we are running a little low on time and we need to meet the marking scheme.
