What did I do last time?
	- I worked on the Driver class and the implementation of a Hashtable.

What will I do next time?
	- I will continue to work on the Driver class.
	- I will also work on any new commands and classes that will be decided after the Sprint Backlog is completed for the second sprint.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- I am still figuring out a design for the Driver class.
	_ I might face additional challenges working on the new commands.
