b) As a user, I must be able to change the current directory to another by a location relative to the current directory or by a full path.
c) As a user, I can push the current working directory onto the directory stack, which behaves in a LIFO manner, and save my changes in a new current working 		
directory that I specify.
d) As a user, I can pop the top (most recent) directory from the directory stack, which behaves in a LIFO manner, and change my current directory into
one the one popped.
e) As a user, I can request that a string is outputted onto a file by itself.
