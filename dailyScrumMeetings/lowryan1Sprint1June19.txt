What did I do last time?
    - I looked over the edited CRC Cards and contributed ideas towards the product backlog and Sprint 1
    - So far, I have been thinking of different ways to implement my tasks assigned in Sprint 1, and 
    researching how to work with directories in Java

What do I plan to do now?
    - Starting from June 19th, I will design and implement a parser for user input and have the parser
    communicate with the History class

Am I blocked on anything?
    - So far, I am still trying to figure out the proper syntax and coding style I shall be using, and 
    I believe my tasks will be easier if I could see how the main container JShell would be implemented first
