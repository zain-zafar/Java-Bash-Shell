What did I do last time?
    - I edited the design for A2 part 1 and with my team we created Sprint1Backlog.txt.  
    - So far I have not worked on the requirements for Sprint1. 

What do I plan to do now?
    - Starting from June 19th, I will create and finish the implementation of cd and pwd.  

Am I blocked on anything?
    - I am not really blocked, however, I think it would be easier if I knew how we will take and check user input. If it is the same as A1, then I shouldn't have a problem.
