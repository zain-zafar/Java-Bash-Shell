What did I do last time?
    - Finished the TrackDirectoriesMade, MakeDirectory, ChangeDirectory classes and added an extra class called ValidateDirectory which changes all relative path directories to absolute path

What do I plan to do now?
    - Today I will try to implement the Tree class.
    - As a group we will change the design based on the feedback    we received in the demo.
    - Finish javaDoc for everything I have comepleted.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - No.
