What did I do last time?
    - I attempted the Echo class and worked more specifically on File and Cat classes
    - I looked at Zain's implementation of Make Directory and tried to format Make File in a similar way

What do I plan to do now?
    - I plan to finish File and Cat (and whatever's left except for find & tree) by the meeting tomorrow

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Currently blocked on figuring out the structure for List of files for Cat
    - The two new functions find & tree look a bit intimidating but I'm sure we can finish the project by
    the deadline
