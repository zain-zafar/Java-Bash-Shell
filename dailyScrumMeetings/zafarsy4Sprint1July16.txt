What did I do last time?
	- Worked on implementing the recursion argument for the ls command. 

What will I do next time?
	- I will make it possible for Driver class to create multiple instances of shell.
	- Create a small project which demos the new design.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Changing the Driver and JShell class will affect alot of the structure. This might be a problem later on.
